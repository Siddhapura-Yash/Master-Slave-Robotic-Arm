# SLAVE-ROBOTIC-ARM-TO-REPLICATE-ALL-MOVEMENT-OF-MASTER-ARM

   **We have built a robotic arm designed to perform repetitive tasks with high accuracy by following predefined steps. Robotic arms have been used to replace people in production lines and are ideally suited for repetitive work. Controlling a robotic arm using switches and joysticks is challenging and requires experience. Our robotic arm overcomes this by replicating movements set through a master robotic arm, allowing it to pick up an object from a table, examine it from all angles, and place it back. This process can be repeated any number of times as needed, reducing human intervention where precision is critical.**
